            <p class="founder-story">
              As an artist and creative visionary, I've always believed that art has the power to connect souls, 
              tell untold stories, and transform ordinary moments into extraordinary experiences. Growing up surrounded 
              by Georgian culture, traditional craftsmanship, and the vibrant colors of our artistic heritage, 
              I discovered my passion for bringing artists together.
            </p>
            <p class="founder-story">
              My journey began with a simple question: <em>How can we create a space where authentic art thrives, 
              where emerging and established artists share the same stage, and where collectors discover pieces 
              that speak to their hearts?</em> That question became Ninart Vision.
            </p>
            <p class="founder-story">
              With years of experience in the art world, I founded this platform not just as a marketplace, 
              but as a movement—a celebration of originality, creativity, and the human spirit expressed through art.
